# CSCI 515 Compiler

Written in C++, from scratch, compiles to x86-64 assembly and executes in-memory.

Works only on UNIX because I didn't have enough time to set up the ABI preambles for Win32.

I don't have a lot of notes on the language itself, so check the tests folder for the syntax format.

Lastly, if you're a future NIU student looking at my code, I would not recommend copying or stealing my code. I deviated
heavily from the professor's design **because** I knew what I was doing. If that wasn't enough to scare you off,
then I should warn you that my framework is *very* customized and difficult to adapt. If *that* doesn't scare you off,
then this will: it's held together with toothpicks and bubblegum. I wrote all of this code the same day it was due with
no regard for human life. Nothing but rage and contempt lay within. You have been warned.
